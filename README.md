Creation Hub
 - Social platform for creating, sharing, and rating NPUs. (Nice Part Usage)


TODOs:
 - Add validaton to the rating, e.g. creativity max 10, etc.
 - Unit tests project
 - Separate into "clean architecture"- Make the controller just call an interface, which has an implementation. and the implementation talks with the db stuff, and instantiates the entities. 
 - Users and auth - What considerations regarding security and user privacy did you have when designing the system?
 - Move the CreationHubContext
 - C4 Model presentation
